## Oldschool Runescape Grand Exchange Data
Since Feb 2019 I have collected over 18,000 snapshots of recent market behaviour from public OSbuddy data. On ~8 minute intervals, this dataset features average-buy, average-sell, buy-quantity, sell-quantity (and more!) for all 3,518 items which are exchange-listable in the game.

An example of the raw data I collect every eight minutes can be found [here](/assets/sale/20190221-153102.txt), and an example spreadsheet of processed data can be found [here](/assets/sale/13190.csv).

I believe this data is prosperous, having personally had moderate success with [pair trading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pairs_trade) as well as [flash crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Flash_Crash) trading where large short term crashes are common in such an illiquid market.

Unfortunately I do not currently have time, nor interest in the game, to further explore forcasting and other trading strategies with this dataset. Hence, it is available for you to purchase for approximately $40 in a cryptocurrency of your choice, but also open to other offers. Email me!

I can also throw in my python notebooks for correlation & flash crash trading, as well as other python utilities to fetch live prices and handle data.
