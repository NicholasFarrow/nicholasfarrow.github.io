Previously I have worked for one of the largest tutoring companies in my area. I offer highschool & university level tutoring for individuals, and also groups at a discounted rate (~4 max). I also offer introductory sessions to subjects like Python programming, HTML & CSS webdesign, and Linux.

For a quote please [email tutoring@nickfarrow.com](mailto:tutoring@nickfarrow.com) with the subject you or your child needs tutoring in! Feel free to attach assignments or relevant coursework, I always prepare for my sessions beforehand.


# University Tutoring
Primarily I tutor mathematics and physics at all levels. I also tutor first year biology, chemistry, and computer science.

Though in the past I have tutored other subjects which I did not complete at university, such as basic machine learning and statistics with `R`. Please [contact me](mailto:nicholas.w.farrow@nickfarrow.com) to inquire about other subjects! Below are a list of some of the units I undertook at Monash University which I am comfortable tutoring:

|------------------------|
| Further Mathematics    |
| Mathematical Methods   |
| Specialist Mathematics |
| Chemistry              |
| Biology                |
| Physics                |

# Other Tutoring
I also offer introductions to a number of other subjects. These subjects are a great choice to **keep your children occupied for a few hours!** In my opinion these are the sessions my students most enjoy, whilst also being highly valuable outside of school/uni:

| General Tutoring              |
|-------------------------------|
| Python (2 & 3, all areas)    |
| HTML & CSS (Web design)       |
| Linux (Installation & Basics) |
