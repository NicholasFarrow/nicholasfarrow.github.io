My name is Nicholas Farrow, I currently am:
* Completing my honours year of Physics at Monash University.
  - My research relates to the detection of [gravitational waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave) which originate from the merger of binary neutron stars.
  - Previously I investigated the [mass distribution of binary neutron stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03300) in our Galaxy.
  - I am now exploring how selection effects influence which binary systems we observe in radio vs gravitational domains.

* part-time mathematics & physics tutor, as well as some ski instructing during the Australian winter.



Most recently I have been interested in:
* Custom unix desktop environments, particularly tiling window manager i3:

* Cryptocurrency tech, primarily decentralised prediction markets & exchanges.
* Web scraping & other quickly cooked up python projects.
