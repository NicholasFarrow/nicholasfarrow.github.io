My name is Nicholas Farrow, I have recently:
* Completed my honours year of Physics at Monash University.
  - My research relates to the interpretation of [gravitational waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave) which can originate from the merger of binary neutron stars.
  - Previously I investigated the [mass distribution of binary neutron stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03300) in our Galaxy.

* Worked as a part-time mathematics & physics tutor, as well as some ski instructing during the Australian winter.

Most recently I have been interested in:
* Learning C through experimenting with [elliptic-curve cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography) and by trying to write a Bitcoin vanity address generator.
* Custom GNU/Linux desktop environments. I recently installed Arch (btw) on my new laptop and have been exploring customisation such as the tiling window manager i3:

* Cryptocurrency tech, primarily decentralised prediction markets & exchanges.
* Web scraping & other quickly cooked up python projects.
